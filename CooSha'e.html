              <h3>why choose us?</h3>
              <p>Choosing  Coosha'e Cares is both a practical 
                decision but also a cost-effective one. Home health care is generally less 
                expensive than hospital stays or skilled nursing facilities. The 
                convenience of receiving care at home means that patients can maintain their routines 
                and stay close to their loved ones, which can significantly enhance their overall 
                well-being and recovery process.</p>
                <p> With Coosha'e Cares, you can rest assured that your 
                health and comfort are our top priorities. </p>
